# libigl Python Biased Dice

This project demonstrates how to design a printable biased dice using optimization and inverse design methods with libigl's Python bindings!

## Installing Dependencies

1. Create a new environment
```bash
conda create --name igl_env python=3.9 --platform osx-64
conda activate igl_env
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
# Install necessary dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge numpy eigen boost

# Install libigl using pip
pip install libigl
```

## Running the Example

### Basic Cube Example

```bash
python simple_cube_example.py
```

This will create a basic cube and display it in the viewer. The program will also save the cube as a `simple_cube.obj` file.

## Notes

- Ensure your system meets all system dependencies for libigl, especially OpenGL-related libraries.
- If you encounter graphics display issues, you may need to check if your GPU drivers are up to date.
- The Python bindings for libigl are still under active development. If you encounter issues, refer to the official documentation and GitHub repository.

## Next Steps

In the upcoming phases of this project, we will:
1. Implement suitable optimization methods for biasing the dice.
2. Develop inverse design techniques to achieve desired probability distributions.
3. Refine the mesh generation process for 3D printing compatibility.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress towards creating a fully functional biased dice design tool!
